Sun chaser is a robot designed to take care of small plant or succulent.

##

#### Overview: 

The Sun-Chasing Robot project, developed as a final year endeavor, showcases an innovative application of Arduino technology to nurture plants by autonomously controlling sunlight exposure and regulating water levels. This project combines Arduino's versatility with a custom-built double-deck car chassis to create a specialized robot designed to cater to the needs of plants.

#### Key Features:

 1.  **Arduino Model Kit:** The project is based on an Arduino model kit, which serves as the brains of the robot. The flexibility of Arduino's programming environment allows for precise control and automation.
    
 2.  **Sunlight Regulation:** The robot employs a UV sensor to detect sunlight levels. It continuously tracks the sun's position, ensuring that the plant receives an optimal amount of sunlight throughout the day.
    
 3.  **Water Management:** To maintain the plant's well-being, the project integrates a soil moisture sensor. This sensor monitors the moisture content in the soil and triggers watering as needed, preventing over or under-watering.
    

**Test Scenarios:** The project's effectiveness and reliability are assessed through a series of four test case scenarios. These scenarios involve adjusting sunlight and water levels to evaluate the robot's ability to cater to the plant's specific requirements.

**Used Hardware:**

 1. Arduino Uno 
 2. UV sensor module (UVM30A)
 3. Soil moisture sensor
 4. Motor Driver
 5. Sensor shield v5.0
 6. DC motors(2)
 7. Wheels
 8. Jumper Wires
 9. Power(9V battery)
 10. 2WD robot car chasis 
 
**Software Requirements:**   Arduino IDE: You can download it from the official Arduino website ([https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)).

**Future Possibilities:** While the current version of the project provides essential functionalities for plant care, there is room for further development and expansion. Future iterations could explore enhancements in plant health monitoring, data analysis, and even remote control capabilities for plant enthusiasts.

This innovative Sun-Chasing Robot project demonstrates the potential of robotics and Arduino technology in creating smart solutions for plant care. Its autonomous operation ensures that your plants receive the attention they deserve, optimizing their growth and well-being.
